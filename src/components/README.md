## Overview

This folder contains reusable components. These components are designed to be feature-agnostic, meaning they can be used in various parts of the application without specific ties to any feature or business logic.

## Component Guidelines

- Components inside this folder should be generic enough to be reused in different parts of the application.
- Avoid hardcoding values and use props for customization.
- Use TypeScript for all components to ensure type safety.
- Use Tailwind for styling.
- Ensure that components are responsive.
- Using unit tests, Storybook is a great advantage.
- use named exports instead of default exports.
